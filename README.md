# Plan

## Small steps

    1. Painting:
       - Cursor should be smooth.. use line interpolation? whatever that is..
    2. Stuff to Encapsulate (Lets try using composition instead):
       - Create an Entity Base Class (This is where everything will inherit)
       
       - Canvas Object              
       - Toolbar Object
       - Brush Object
       - Button Object
    
    3. For dealing with entities
       - A Vector for holding entity pointers.
        an update() method for each entity (pass in delta time and mouse_pos);

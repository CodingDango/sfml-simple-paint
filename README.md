Absolutely, let's break down the coordinate math slowly. It's very common for this to feel a bit like a mental puzzle until it clicks! We'll use Approach 1 from before, as it's often the most intuitive for a canvas.

The Goal: You want to draw your Brush's shape onto your m_render_texture (the canvas's internal drawing surface) so that when you later draw m_sprite (which uses m_render_texture as its texture) onto the main window, the brush mark appears exactly where the user's mouse (and thus the logical Brush position) was on the window.

Imagine Three "Spaces":

World Space (or Window View Space):

This is the coordinate system of your main game window after your view/camera transformations.

When sf::Mouse::getPosition(window) is called and then window.mapPixelToCoords(...), the resulting sf::Vector2f mouse_pos is in this space.

Your Brush object's logical position (m_brush_ptr->getShape()->getPosition()) should be in this World Space. Let's call this brushWorldPosition.

Your Canvas's m_sprite is also positioned in this WorldCompletely understandable. Coordinate math can be tricky, and when your brain is tired, it's like trying to see through fog. Let's break down the coordinate math for rendering the brush onto the canvas very simply, using an analogy and diagrams.

The Goal: Your Brush "thinks" it's at a certain spot in the main game world (e.g., where your mouse is). But you want to stamp its shape onto your Canvas's private drawing paper (m_render_texture). This "private paper" is then put onto a Space using m_sprite.setPosition(). Let's call this canvasSpriteWorldPosition. This is effectively the top-left corner of your visible canvas area in the world.

m_render_texture's Local Texture Space:

Think of m_render_texture as a blank sheet of digital paper.

By default (if you haven't set a custom view on it), its own top-left corner is (0,0).

When you call m_render_texture.draw(someShape), someShape.getPosition() is interpreted clipboard (m_sprite) and that clipboard is placed somewhere on your main desk (the window).

Imagine:

Your Desk (sf::RenderWindow or dest): This is your main view of the world. It has its own coordinate system. Let's say its top-left is (0,0) of the world.

A Piece of Paper (your m_render_texture): This is the canvas's drawing surface. When you draw directly onto this paper, its own top-left corner is relative to this (0,0) top-left of the texture itself.

m_sprite's Local Space (Less relevant for drawing onto the texture):

The m_sprite uses m_render_texture as its image source. m_sprite itself has an origin (usually (0,0) by default, its top-left) and a position in World Space. This effectively (0,0) for that paper.

A Clipboard (your m_sprite): You tape your "Piece of Paper" (m_render_texture) onto this clipboard. The clipboard itself can then be placed anywhere on your "Desk" (dest).

m_sprite.setPosition(canvasX, canvasY); means the top-left of the clipboard (and thus your paper) is at (canvasX is handled when youdest.draw(m_sprite)`.

The Math: Relating World Space to Texture Local Space

You want the brush mark X to appear at brushWorldPosition when m_sprite is finally drawn.
The m_sprite itself is placed at canvasSpriteWorldPosition.

Let the position where you need to draw the brush mark inside m_render_texture be brushPositionForTexture.

If canvasSpriteWorldPosition was (0,0) (i.e., the, canvasY)` on the Desk.

A Rubber Stamp (your Brush):

You know where you want the center of the stamp to hit the "Desk". Let's call canvas sprite's top-left aligns with the world's top-left), then brushPositionForTexture would simply be brushWorldPosition. You'd draw at (120,80) on the texture, and it would appear at (120,80) on the screen.

But your canvasSpriteWorldPosition is (100,50). This means the (0,0) of your m_render thisbrushWorldPosition. This ism_brush_ptr->getShape()->getPosition()`.

The Problem:
You want to make a mark with your "Rubber Stamp" onto the "Piece of Paper".
If brushWorldPosition is (300, 200) on the "Desk", and your "Piece of Paper" (via the clipboard) is also placed at (300, 200) on the "Desk", then to hit the very top-left of your paper, the stamp actually needs to be aimed at (0,0) relative to the paper's own coordinate system.

The Math: brushPositionForTexture = brushWorldPosition - canvasSpriteWorldPosition;

Let's use an example:

*_texture(when displayed viam_sprite) effectively "starts" at(100,50)in the world. * If you want something to appear at world X-coordinate120, and the canvas starts at world X-coordinate100, then on the canvas paper itself, you need to draw it120 - 100 = 20pixels from the left edge of the paper. * If you want something to appear at world Y-coordinate80, and the canvas starts at world Y-coordinate50, then on the canvas paper itself, you need to draw it80 - 50 = 3 Your Desk (dest) is, say, 800x600.

You place your Clipboard (m_sprite) so its top-left corner is at canvasSpriteWorldPosition = (100, 50) on the Desk. This means your "Piece of Paper" (m_render_texture) effectively starts at (100, 50) in world coordinates.

Your Brush (m_brush_ptr) is aimed at **brushWorldPosition = (120, 70 pixels from the top edge of the paper.

So, the calculation is:

brushPositionForTexture.x = brushWorldPosition.x - canvasSpriteWorldPosition.x
brushPositionForTexture.y = brushWorldPosition.y - canvasSpriteWorldPosition.y

Or, in vector form:
brushPositionForTexture = brushWorldPosition - canvasSpriteWorldPosition

Let's walk through the Canvas::render0)` on the Desk. You want the center of the brush mark to appear at this world location.

's top-left.
sf::Vector2f brushPositionForTexture = brushWorldPosition - canvasSpriteWorldNow, when you are about to call m_render_texture.draw(*brushShape), the brushShape needsPosition;
// brushPositionForTexture.x = 120 - 100 = 20 its position set relative to the Piece of Paper's own (0,0) corner.

`
// brushPositionForTexture.y = 80 - 50 = 30
// So, brushPositionForTexture = (20, 30)

// 4. Store the brush's originalbrushWorldPosition.x` is 120.

canvasSpriteWorldPosition.x is 100.

The brush is 120 - 100 = 20 pixels to world position
sf::Vector2f originalBrushWorldPosition = currentBrushShape->getPosition(); // (120, 80)

// 5. Temporarily set the brush shape's position for drawing onto the render texture
currentBrushShape->setPosition(brushPositionForTexture); // Brush shape's position is now (20, the right of the paper's left edge.
So, brushPositionForTexture.x = 20.

brushWorldPosition.y is 70.

canvasSpriteWorldPosition.y is 50.

The brush is 70 - 50 = 20 pixels down from the paper's top edge.
So, brushPositionForTexture.y = 20. 30)

// 6. Draw the brush shape onto the render texture
// m_render_texture is like a blank paper. Its top-left is (0,0) for drawing purposes.
// When we draw currentBrushShape (which is now at (20,30)), its origin
// will be placed 20 pixels from the left and 30 pixels from the top of m_render_texture.
m_render_texture.draw(*currentBrushShape);

// 7. Restore the brush shape's

Therefore, brushPositionForTexture = (20, 20).

Inside Canvas::render:

brushWorldPosition = (120, 70) (from brushShape->getPosition())

canvasSpriteWorldPosition = (100, 50) (from m_sprite.getPosition())

brushPositionForTexture = (120, 70) - (100, 50) = (20, 20)

You temporarily do: brushShape->setPosition(20, 20);

Then you call: `m_render_texture.draw original world position
currentBrushShape->setPosition(originalBrushWorldPosition); // Brush shape's position back to (120, 80)

// --- Finished drawing onto m_render_texture for this frame ---
m_render_texture.display();

// --- Draw the canvas (m_sprite) onto the final destination (window) ---
// m_sprite's texture is now m_render_texture (which has the mark at its(*brushShape);`
This draws the brush shape onto the "Piece of Paper" at coordinates (20,20) relative to the paper's top-left corner.

You then restore: brushShape->setPosition(120, 70); (so the brush object itself is still correct in world space).
local (20,30)).
// m_sprite itself is positioned at canvasSpriteWorldPosition (100, 50) in the window.
// So, the mark that was at (20,307. Later, dest.draw(m_sprite); draws the clipboard (with the paper and the new) ON THE TEXTURE will end up at:
// Window_X = m_sprite.x + texture_mark.x = 100 + 20 = 120
// Window_Y = m mark) onto the Desk. Since the clipboard is at (100,50) on the Desk, and the mark_sprite.y + texture_mark.y = 50 + 30 = 80
is at (20,20) on the paper, the mark visually appears at (100+20, 50+20) = (120, 70) on the Desk.// This is (120, 80) -- exactly brushWorldPosition!
dest.draw(m_sprite Which is exactly where you wanted it (brushWorldPosition).

**Analogy:**

*   `brushWorldPosition`: Where you want your sticker to end up on a big wall map.
*   `canvasSpriteWorldPosition`: You have a smaller piece of paper (your:
*   `O` = Origin of the World (0,0)
*   `C` = `canvasSpriteWorldPosition` (Vector from O to top-left of canvas sprite)
*   `B` = `m_render_texture` displayed by `m_sprite`) that you will stick onto the wall map. This `brushWorldPosition` (Vector from O to where brush should be in world)

You want the vector from `C is the coordinate on the wall map where the top-left of your small paper will go.

You're transforming the brush's *world* coordinates into *canvas-local* coordinates for the brief moment you're drawing onto the `m_render_texture`. Then you put the brush' it out on paper if it helps!

2. Draw a smaller rectangle inside it for where `m_sprite` is (this is `canvasSpriteWorldPosition`). This smallers coordinate back to world space.
